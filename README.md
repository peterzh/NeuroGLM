# NeuroGLM

This will be a MATLAB toolbox for the analysis of neural and behavioural data under a decision making task. The toolbox will incorporate models to quantify to what extent recorded neural spiking activity relates to external and internal variables of decision.

Classical approaches rely on Signal Detection Theory to quantify latent features of perception (sensitivity, bias). A new GLM approach has been developed which offers greater flexibility for modeling the effect of internal and external variables of interest on a task.
